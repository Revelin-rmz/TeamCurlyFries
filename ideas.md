## 1. Blockchain-Based Esports Tournament Platform

### Overview

The Blockchain-Based Esports Tournament Platform will leverage Avalanche's subnet for high throughput and scalability, and NEAR Protocol for managing digital assets and ensuring secure, transparent transactions. The platform will support tournament organization, participant tracking, and reward distribution in the form of cryptocurrency.

### Key Features

- **User Registration and Profiles:** Secure user registration and profile management.
- **Tournament Creation and Management:** Tools for creating and managing esports tournaments.
- **Participant Tracking:** Real-time tracking of participant performance and match outcomes.
- **Reward Distribution:** Secure and transparent distribution of cryptocurrency rewards.
- **Decentralized Item Marketplace:** A marketplace for trading in-game items and rewards.

### Software and Dependencies

- **Frontend:**

  - Frameworks: React.js or Vue.js for building the user interface.
  - Libraries: Web3.js or Ethers.js for interacting with blockchain networks.
  - Styling: Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap for styling and responsive design.

- **Backend:**

  - Framework: Node.js with Express.js for server-side logic and APIs.
  - Database: MongoDB for storing user profiles, tournament data, and match outcomes.
  - Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication.

- **Blockchain Integration:**
  - Avalanche Subnet: For high throughput and scalability.
  - NEAR Protocol: For managing digital assets and token rewards.
  - Teleporter: For enabling cross-chain communication and asset transfers.

### Build Structure

1. **User Registration and Authentication:**

   - Users register using email or social media accounts.
   - Profiles are stored in MongoDB with secure JWT-based authentication.

2. **Tournament Creation and Management:**

   - Tournament organizers create tournaments through a user-friendly interface.
   - Tournament details, including schedules, rules, and prize pools, are stored on the Avalanche subnet.

3. **Participant Tracking:**

   - Match outcomes and participant performance are recorded in real-time.
   - Data is stored on the Avalanche subnet and synchronized with MongoDB for quick access.

4. **Reward Distribution:**

   - Winners are automatically rewarded with cryptocurrency.
   - Rewards are distributed using smart contracts on the NEAR Protocol.

5. **Decentralized Item Marketplace:**
   - Players can trade in-game items and rewards.
   - Marketplace transactions are handled using smart contracts on the Avalanche subnet.

### Development Strategies

- **Agile Development:** Use agile methodologies for iterative development, ensuring continuous integration and delivery.
- **Smart Contract Audits:** Regular audits of smart contracts to ensure security and reliability.
- **User Feedback:** Collect and incorporate user feedback for continuous improvement.
- **Scalability:** Design the platform to handle high traffic and large volumes of transactions.
